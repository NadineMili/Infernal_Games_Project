what are the first words that come to
00:03
mind
00:04
when you think of a person with cancer
00:08
you may have thought some things like
00:10
brave sick
00:12
strong warrior
00:15
what are the first words that come to
00:17
mind when you think of a person with a
00:19
mental illness
00:22
we commonly hear people say things like
00:25
weak
00:25
sad violent unstable crazy
00:29
even looking for attention this is
00:32
stigma in action first let's define
00:35
stigma
00:37
according to merriam-webster stigma is a
00:39
mark of shame or discredit
00:43
the cambridge dictionary defines stigma
00:45
as a strong feeling of disapproval
00:48
that most people in a society have about
00:50
something
00:51
especially when that disapproval is
00:53
unfair
00:55
historically the stigma associated with
00:57
mental illness
00:58
caused mentally ill people to be
01:00
institutionalized thrown in jail or even
01:03
killed
01:04
people did not understand mental illness
01:06
so they were afraid of it
01:08
while these atrocities have greatly
01:10
diminished in our world today
01:12
stigma is still alive and well in our
01:15
societies
01:17
here is how we may see stigma today many
01:20
people attribute mental illness as a
01:22
weakness or character flaw
01:24
but the reality is that mental illness
01:26
is a disease of the brain
01:28
people with depression are sick just
01:31
like people with cancer
01:33
like cancer patients people with mental
01:35
illness are strong and brave
01:37
because they battle their illness every
01:39
day often times alone
01:41
but many people refer to them as crazy
01:44
or unstable
01:45
[Music]
01:46
finally many people say those with
01:49
mental illness
01:50
just want attention which is untrue
01:53
invalidating and hurtful
01:56
stigma is harmful because it prevents us
01:58
from opening up to others about our
02:00
struggles and from seeking treatment
02:03
the negative effects of stigma are very
02:06
strong
02:07
the average delay between the onset of
02:09
symptoms and the start of treatment
02:11
is 8 to 11 years
02:14
we would never wait that long if we had
02:16
a broken bone or trouble breathing
02:19
lack of mental health knowledge and lack
02:22
of access to care
02:23
also prevent us from getting treatment
02:26
but stigma
02:27
plays a large role as well
02:30
so what can we do about it thankfully
02:34
things are improving
02:35
here are some other steps that you can
02:37
take to be a mental health
02:39
ally be educated on and literate in
02:42
mental health
02:43
this is the best way to combat stigma
02:47
use the right language avoid saying
02:50
things that perpetuate stigma
02:52
like i'm so bipolar right now or
02:55
you're so ocd about cleaning or
02:59
they're just acting crazy so that they
03:00
can get attention
03:02
be open-minded listen to people who have
03:05
experienced mental illness
03:07
how they have been stigmatized and how
03:09
it has affected their lives
03:12
speak up and correct others who do
03:14
stigmatize
03:16
and finally create a safe and supportive
03:19
environment for those living with mental
03:22
illness
03:24

03:26
